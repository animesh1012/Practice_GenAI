## Overview

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems capable of creating content such as text, images, and audio. This repository serves as a sandbox for experimenting with GenAI models and refining prompt engineering skills. The goal is to understand how different prompts influence the outputs of various generative models and to develop best practices for effective prompt design.

## Features

- **Prompt Engineering Exercises**: A collection of exercises aimed at improving skills in crafting prompts for GenAI models.
- **Model Implementations**: Examples of implementing and interacting with different GenAI models.
- **Resource Compilation**: Curated list of articles, tutorials, and guides on Generative AI and prompt engineering.
